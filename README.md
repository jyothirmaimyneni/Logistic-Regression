# Logistic-Regression
Binary logistic regression model is used to find out the person who is diagnosed with the diabetes, utilising the blood samples and it’s characteristics.
The dataset was divided into a training dataset and a test dataset. There are 757 samples in the training set and 190 samples in the test set. 53 Pre-Diabetic (‘P’) patients have also been isolated, which we will subsequently assess.
As a part of model selection, we chose binary logistic regression to predict whether the patient is diabetic or non-diabetic. This approach is effective in estimating the likelihood that a given instance will fall into a specific category.
